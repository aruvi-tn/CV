                <h3>A Bridge Between Design and Production</h3>
                <p>I am a Senior Naval Architect with over six years of progressive experience, currently leading technical projects in the UK's marine technology sector. My career has been defined by a focus on the practical application of engineering—transforming complex designs into tangible, high-quality marine structures.</p>
                <p>After building a strong foundation in production design and team leadership in India, I pursued an MSc in Maritime Engineering Science from the University of Southampton to deepen my expertise in advanced marine systems. This blend of hands-on experience and advanced education allows me to effectively manage projects from concept through to completion.</p>
                <p>My goal is to work in environments that demand precision, quality, and technical excellence. I thrive on solving complex problems and coordinating with diverse teams to achieve exceptional results.</p>
